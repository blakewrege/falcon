<h2>Catalog Data:</h2>

<p>Name: CS4430 - Principles of Database Management Systems<br>
Credit Hours: 3<br>
Prerequisite: CS3310 - Data and File Structures</p>

<h2>Course Description:</h2>

<p>This is our first course in DBMS. It gives an application-oriented
introduction to DBMS. Topics we cover include basic concepts,
data models (Entity-Relationship, relational), relational
operations, SQL, database application development and database
design theory. After this course, students are expected to be
familiar with basic concepts in databases. Students are also
expected to be able to design and use relational databases and to
develop database applications. Students are required to complete
a database project by the end of the semester.</p>

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

<p>The general objective of this first course in DBMS is to
introduce students basic concepts, techniques and systems for
data management so that students are able to design their own
databases, write database queries, and develop database
applications. Specific objectives include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Understand basic concepts in databases and DBMSs</li>
    <li>Understand the relational theory.</li>
    <li>Develop skills needed to design relational databases.</li>
    <li>Develop skills to write database queries.</li>
    <li>Get experience of database programming and application
        development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>

<p>Upon completion of this course, students are be able to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Explain basic concepts in databases and benefits of
        databases to organizations. </li>
    <li>Design databases using the E-R model. </li>
    <li>Transform database schema into normalized designs. </li>
    <li>Implement designs using SQL on at least one DBMS platform.
    </li>
    <li>Query databases using SQL. </li>
    <li>Write database programs. </li>
    <li>Develop Internet database applications. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Textbook:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Jeffrey D. Ullman and Jennifer Widom. A First Course in
        Database Systems. 3rd Edition. Prentice Hall, 2007. ISBN:
        978-0136006374. The authors maintain a book web site at <a
        href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/fcdb.html">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/fcdb.html</a>
        where you can find a lot of useful stuff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation:</h2>

<p>There will be assignments, an implementation project, a
midterm exam and a final exam. Your final grade is determined
based on a weighted sum of your scores. Weights of the scores are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Assignments: 20%</li>
    <li>Midterm: 20%</li>
    <li>Final Exam: 30%</li>
    <li>Project: 30% <ul>
            <li>Project should be carried out in teams. Each team
                should ideally have 2 students. Find a scenario
                from your daily life or experience that requires
                database support. Then email me your project
                title and a short abstract.</li>
            <li>Each group is expected to complete the project
                independently. Project presentation will be
                scheduled at the end of this semester.
                Presentation schedule will be posted online.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>The following code is required to be included in this syllabus:</p>

<p><em>You are responsible for making yourself aware of and
understanding the policies and procedures in the Undergraduate (pp.
271-272) [Graduate (pp. 24-26)] Catalog that pertain to Academic
Integrity. These policies include cheating, fabrication,
falsification and forgery, multiple submission, plagiarism,
complicity and computer misuse. If there is reason to believe you
have been involved in academic dishonesty, you will be referred
to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. You will be given the
opportunity to review the charge(s). If you believe you are not
responsible, you will have the opportunity for a hearing. You
should consult with me if you are uncertain about an issue of
academic honesty prior to the submission of an assignment or test.</em></p>
