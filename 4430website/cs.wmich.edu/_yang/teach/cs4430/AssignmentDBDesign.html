<h1>CS4430 Assignment 5: Database Design</h1>

<hr>

<p>Let us suppose that WMU Registrar's Office needs a database to
handle students' transcript data. </p>

<p>The database keeps track of each student's name, WIN, current
address &amp; phone, permanent address &amp; phone, birthdate,
sex, level (freshman, sophomore, ......, master, phd), major (a 4-char code), 
and home department. Some applications
need to refer individually to the city, state (2-char abbrv.) and
zip code (some use 5-digit, some use 9) of the students' address.
Some applications need to refer to students' first and last names
separately. WIN is unique to the student.</p>

<p>Each department has a name, a 4-char code, location (main
building and room number), office phone, college, and a list of
instructors.&nbsp; Department codes are unique within the
university.</p>

<p>Each instructor has his/her WIN, first name and last name.</p>

<p>The course catalog contains the list of courses which WMU
offers. Each course has a number (e.g. 4430), name, description,
credit hours &amp; department. Course numbers are unique within a
department, but not unique across the university (so taken
together, they are unique). Not every course is offered every
semester.</p>

<p>Each section has a single instructor (first and last names -
no team-taught class), semester, year (4-digit), course
number and section number. </p>

<p>A grade report contains the student's name, WIN, course number
&amp; section, letter grade (A, BA, B, ..., E, X, I).</p>

<p><em>Note: If the above user requirements leave out any
important detail, assume that it is handled the way WMU does
things in the real world.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>This assignment has two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conceptual Design: Draw an E-R diagram of the above information.</li>
<li>Logical Design: Convert the E-R diagram to a relational schema. Express the 
schema using SQL CREATE TABLE statements, with proper primary keys and foreign 
keys identified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare your submission in Word or PDF format and submit to e-learning.</p>
