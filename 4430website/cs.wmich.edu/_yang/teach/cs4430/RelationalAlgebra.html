<hr>

<p>Assume a book store has a mail-order database with the
following schema of relations: (Primary keys are underlined.
Meaning of each attribute is self-explanatory by its name.)</p>

<p>EMPLOYEES: &lt;<u>ENO</u>, ENAME, ZIP, HIRE_DATE&gt;; <br>
BOOKS: &lt;<u>ISBN</u>, BNAME, QUANTITY, PRICE&gt;;<br>
CUSTOMERS: &lt;<u>CNO</u>, CNAME, STREET, ZIP, PHONE&gt;;<br>
ORDERS: &lt;<u>ONO</u>, CNO, ENO, RECEIVED, SHIPPED&gt;; <br>
ORDER_DETAILS: &lt;<u>ONO, ISBN</u>, QTY&gt;; <br>
ZIPCODES: &lt;<u>ZIP</u>, CITY, STATE&gt;;</p>

<p>Convert the following queries into relational algebraic
expressions: </p>

<ol>
    <li>list customers (names) the zip of whose address is either
        49008 or 49009. </li>
    <li>list employees (names) who have customers in Indiana.</li>
    <li>list employees (names) who have both 49008-zipcode
        customers and 49009-zipcode customers.</li>
    <li>list customers (CNOs and names) who live in Kalamazoo,
        excluding a special customer who's CNO is 1111.</li>
    <li>list customers (names) who've ordered books through an
        employee named 'Jones'.</li>
    <li>list customers (names) who've NOT ordered the book &quot;Database
        Systems&quot;.</li>
    <li>all possible pairs of books (BNAMEs). (Don't include 2 of
        the same books in a pair).</li>
    <li>all possible pairs of books (BNAMEs) where the first has
        a price of 24.99 and the second has a price of 19.99.</li>
    <li>customers (names) who ordered at least one book that
        customer #1111 ordered.</li>
    <li>customers (names) who ordered all the books as customer #11111
        ordered (although, they may have ordered additional books).</li>
</ol>
<p>Prepare your answers using a word processor and submit to the WMU e-learning 
portal.</p>
